WebSocket – Definition & Explanation



1. What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a full-duplex communication protocol that allows real-time,

two-way communication between a client (browser) and a server over a single

persistent connection.



Unlike HTTP, WebSocket does not require the client to send a request every

time to receive data.



2. Why WebSocket is needed?

Traditional HTTP works on a request–response model:

- Client sends request

- Server sends response

- Connection closes



This is slow and inefficient for real-time applications.



WebSocket solves this problem by:

- Keeping the connection open

- Allowing server to push data instantly

- Reducing network overhead



3. Key Features of WebSocket

- Full-duplex communication

- Single persistent connection

- Low latency

- Real-time data transfer

- Works over TCP

- Supports secure connection (wss://)



4. WebSocket vs HTTP

HTTP: One-way, high latency, no real-time

WebSocket: Two-way, low latency, real-time



5. How WebSocket Works

- Client sends HTTP handshake request

- Server upgrades protocol to WebSocket

- Connection remains open

- Client and server can send messages anytime

- Connection closes explicitly



6. WebSocket URL Types

ws://  -> Non-secure WebSocket

wss:// -> Secure WebSocket



7. Where WebSocket is used?

- Chat applications

- Stock market updates

- Online multiplayer games

- Live tracking systems

- Notifications

- Collaborative tools



8. WebSocket in Spring Boot

- @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker

- STOMP protocol

- SockJS support



Components:

- WebSocket config

- Controller with @MessageMapping

- Message broker (/topic)

- Client using SockJS + STOMP



9. STOMP Protocol

STOMP is used on top of WebSocket to support publish/subscribe messaging.



Examples:

- /app/chat.send

- /topic/public



10. Advantages

- Faster communication

- Real-time updates

- Less bandwidth usage

- Better user experience



11. Disadvantages

- More complex than HTTP

- Needs connection management

- Not suitable for simple APIs



12. Conclusion

WebSocket is ideal for real-time communication such as chat applications,

live dashboards, and streaming data.

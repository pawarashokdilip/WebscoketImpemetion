WebSocket ‚Äì Definition & Explanation
1. What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a full-duplex communication protocol that allows real-time, two-way communication between a client (browser) and a server over a single persistent connection.

Unlike HTTP, WebSocket does not require the client to send a request every time to receive data.

2. Why WebSocket is needed?

Traditional HTTP works on a request‚Äìresponse model:

Client sends request

Server sends response

Connection closes

This is slow and inefficient for real-time applications.

WebSocket solves this problem by:

Keeping the connection open

Allowing server to push data instantly

Reducing network overhead

3. Key Features of WebSocket

Ì¥Ñ Full-duplex communication

Ì¥ó Single persistent connection

‚ö° Low latency

Ì≥° Real-time data transfer

Ìºê Works over TCP

Ì¥í Supports secure connection (wss://)

4. WebSocket vs HTTP
Feature	HTTP	WebSocket
Communication	One-way	Two-way
Connection	Closed after response	Persistent
Latency	High	Very Low
Real-time	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Server push	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
5. How WebSocket Works (Flow)

Client sends HTTP handshake request

Server upgrades protocol to WebSocket

Connection remains open

Client and server can send messages anytime

Connection closes only when explicitly closed

6. WebSocket URL Types

ws:// ‚Üí Non-secure WebSocket

wss:// ‚Üí Secure WebSocket (recommended)

7. Where WebSocket is used?

WebSocket is used in real-time applications, such as:

Ì≤¨ Chat applications

Ì≥à Stock market live updates

ÌæÆ Online multiplayer games

Ì≥ç Live tracking systems

Ì¥î Notifications systems

Ì¥ù Collaborative tools

8. WebSocket in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides WebSocket support using:

@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker

STOMP protocol

SockJS (fallback support)

Common Components:

WebSocket Configuration class

Controller with @MessageMapping

Message Broker (/topic)

Client using SockJS + STOMP

9. STOMP Protocol

STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) is used on top of WebSocket to:

Define message destinations

Simplify message handling

Support publish/subscribe model

Example:

/app/chat.send ‚Üí client sends message

/topic/public ‚Üí server broadcasts message

10. Advantages of WebSocket

Faster communication

Real-time updates

Less bandwidth usage

Better user experience

11. Disadvantages of WebSocket

More complex than HTTP

Requires connection management

Not ideal for simple request-response APIs

12. Conclusion

WebSocket is the best choice for real-time communication in modern applications.
It provides low-latency, bidirectional communication, making it ideal for chat apps, live dashboards, and streaming data.
